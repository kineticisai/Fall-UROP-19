# abstractNLP

The goal of this project was to create a text dataset of research papers for use with a pre-trained language model for text summarization and text generation.
Our dataset was a dump of arXiv research papers in LaTeX format, and our task was to write a script to parse the LaTeX, and separate the abstract from the paper.
